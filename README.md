# Improved-tetris
Rules of the game: one hand controls the falling figures, as in regular Tetris. The second hand is responsible for the hero, who must dodge the figures and can jump on them. The goal is for the hero to get to the top of the field by pieces. You lose if the wall of figures reaches the top faster than the hero.
